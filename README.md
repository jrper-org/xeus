# C++ example with codespaces & classrooms

You can run this C++/Xeus example live via a GitHub codespaces window by doing the following:

1. Click on the Code button above

2. Select the "Codespaces" tab, and then click the "Create Codespaces on Main" button.
  ![](./images/codespaces_tab.jpeg)


It might take up to 10 minutes for the codespace to be created the first time you start it. Once the image has been created, it should relaunch fairly fast.
